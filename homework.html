    <h2>Welcome to My Page</h2>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Riccardo Ramirez, I am from Bogota, New Jersey, and this is a little bit about me. I have 5 people in my house, including my Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, and me. I also have a pet Guinea Pig named Cocoa. I was born and raised here in New Jersey, and have never switched schools until now. My family and I like to travel every year, and this year I went to Europe for the first time. We have a big extended family that likes to get together a lot, and we all go on Vacation together for 1 week at the end of the summer.</p>
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>My main hobby is soccer. My entire family are <strong>BIG</strong> soccer fanatics, and have all played or coached before. The soccer team we support is <em>Chelsea FC.</em> I have been playing soccer since I was <strong>3 YEARS OLD.</strong> Right now, I play travel soccer for a team that is <strong>2</strong> years up my age group. My dad coached me in Recreation Soccer when I was younger, and my brother coached me for the last 3 years. Now, I am on a new team, learning to play with new teammates, and have fun.  </p>
    <h3>Other Things I Like</h3>
    <p>Some other interests I have is playing video games and playing Basketball. Some video games I like to play are <em>Roblox, Rainbow Six Siege, EAFC 25,</em> and different games on my Virtual Reality Headset. If I had to choose my favorite one, it would probably be Roblox. There is a lot of different games on there, of all different genres including Horror, Sports, team, etc. For Basketball, last year I played on a  team, and did really well and got called up for a tournament. Since then, I haven't played too much because I have been focused on school. That is some of my other hobbies I do in my free time.</p>
