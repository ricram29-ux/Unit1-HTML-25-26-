    <h1>My Dream Trip to England</h1>
    <h2>research"Ultimate travel Guide</h2>
    <p>My dream is to go to England to watch a soccer game. My favorite team is based in London, and I really want to watch them play. You can purchase a tour of the stadium at <a href="https://www.viator.com/London/d737-ttd/p-76711P1?m=33953&supag=1231454090753302&supsc=dat-2328765628373689&supai=76966013752231&supdv=c&supnt=nt:o&suplp=98379&supli=4923&supti=dat-2328765628373689&tsem=true&supci=dat-2328765628373689&supkw=chelsea%20fc%20stadium%20tour&&m=33953&supag=1231454090753302&supsc=dat-2328765628373689&supai=76966013752231&supdv=c&supnt=nt:o&suplp=98379&supli=4923&supti=dat-2328765628373689&tsem=true&supci=dat-2328765628373689&supkw=chelsea%20fc%20stadium%20tour&msclkid=c5d5c3784f651c0b639dabb0dc2c0acb&gclid=c5d5c3784f651c0b639dabb0dc2c0acb&gclsrc=3p.ds&gad_source=7"> </Target> Chelsea Museum Tour.</a> Also, if you are looking for other things to do, going to the stadium isn't the only thing. You can find some activities at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g186338-London_England-Vacations.html"><Target>Trip Asdvisor</Target></a>. To check if the weather is good, we can use a reliable weather app. My choice for the weather app is <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/0b8697c01baca04214b4abd206319d3eba60db5fb05c191012c4e02f6bdb23a4"><target>Weather.com</target></a>.

In the third link, you will find access to the current weather in the place you want to go to.</p> <hr>
    <h2>Getting There and Staying There</h2>
    <h3>Flight and Hotel Booking</h3>
    <p>If you end up deciding to stay here, then you need to find a place to stay, and a way to get there. I would recommend using websites like Expedia and Booking.com. They are noth great ways to find a place to stay in the area you want to be. If your looking for cheap flights, use <a href="https://www.expedia.com/?locale=en_US&siteid=1&semcid=US.B.BING.BT-c-EN.GT&semdtl=a1686369380.b11326012568329084.g1kwd-82876631714807:loc-190.e1c.m1a4f1117ca4e415b1337d79b43d0b513e.r144e19ae75cefa7a4feb373d0090094741f7e94c9077d61fe15e5a886a61ad68c.c1.j198379.k1.d182876071236484.h1e.i1.l1.n1.o1.p1.q1.s1.t1.x1.f1.u1.v1.w1&msclkid=a4f1117ca4e415b1337d79b43d0b513e"><target>Expedia</target></a>, and if your looking for good prices on Hotels, use <a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=2369661&pagename=en-us-booking-desktop&label=msn-8zoYOfVtrBOEstYLRvkliA-80195816981646:tikwd-80195992120973:loc-190:neo:mte:lp98379:dec:qsbooking.com&utm_campaign=English_United_States%20EN%20US&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=bing&utm_term=8zoYOfVtrBOEstYLRvkliA&msclkid=3b9f8ee7562b18468da8e62fcc01dc95&utm_content=Booking%20-%20Desktop"><target>Booking.com</target></a>. Both of these are great websites for planning your trip overall.</p> <hr>
    <h3>Transportation Info</h3>
    <p>If you are looking for easy ways to get around in London, then I would recommend using the bus. You can fin dwhere the bus arrival times are at <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/"><target>London Bus Times</target></a>. If you really wanted to, you can takw the subway, or as they call it, the Tube, at <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/"><target>London Subway(Tube)Times</target></a>. There is some other ways around, but these two are the main ones for transportation. The distance and area that my dream vacation is at is in London which you can find on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/London,+UK/@51.5286416,-0.1015987,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!8m2!3d51.5072178!4d-0.1275862!16zL20vMDRqcGw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D"><target>Google Maps</target></a>.</p> <hr>
